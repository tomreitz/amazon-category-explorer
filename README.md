# Amazon Category Explorer (ACE)
This repo contains the source code for my final project in CS744 (Visualization) at UW-Madison in Fall 2020: Amazon Category Explorer (ACE)

`all-nodes.csv` is the given product category data.
`data-to-json.py` is a python script which converts the data to a JSON tree structure which is used byt the app. It can be run with `python3 data-to-json.py > tree.json`.
`index.html` is the main app page, `about.html` has some background information about the project.
